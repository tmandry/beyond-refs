//!
//! This module provides traits to customize the place operations of Rust.
//!
//! ## Places and Place Expressions
//!
//! A *place* in Rust is a particular location in memory. Places are represented
//! by [*place expressions*][ref-place-exprs], which have the following syntax:
//!
//! [ref-place-exprs]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/expressions.html#r-expr.place-value.place-expr-kinds
//!
//! - `$path`: paths that refer to local variables (also parameters) and
//!   statics,
//! - `*$place`: dereferencing another place expression,
//! - `$place[$expr]`: indexing into another place expression,
//! - `$place.$ident`: accessing a field of another place expression,
//! - `($place)`: parenthesized place expressions,
//! - `$value`: an arbitrary expression; it's value is stored in a temporary
//!   place whose lifetime is determined from its context.
//!
//! Further reading:
//! - <https://nadrieril.github.io/blog/2025/12/06/on-places-and-their-magic.html>
//! - <https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2024/08/14/places.html>
//!
//! Place expressions have a direct representation in the form of a
//! [`PlaceHandle`]. A handle points at a place and is responsible for
//! performing all available place operations on the represented place. Any
//! valid place expression is converted into a handle by the compiler. We give
//! this desugaring as a pseudo[^1]-macro definition:
//!
//! [^1]: we use the non-existent macro fragment specifiers of `place` for place
//!       expressions and `member` for struct field names and tuple indices.
//!       Additionally, we require eager expansion of macros, as we use the
//!       output of the `handle!` macro in the input of the `subplace!` macro.
//!
//! ```rust
//! macro_rules! handle {
//!     ($path:path) => { LocalHandle::new(&raw {const,mut} $path) };
//!
//!     ($place:place[$expr:expr]) => {
//!         <
//!             typeof($place) as IndexPlace<typeof($expr), _>
//!         >::index(handle!($place), $expr)
//!     };
//!
//!     (*$place:place) => { DerefPlace::deref_place(handle!($place)) };
//!
//!     ($place:place.$field:member) => {
//!         let subplace
//!             = subplace!(typeof($place), $field, handle!($place));
//!         ProjectPlace::<typeof(subplace)>::project_place(
//!             handle!($place),
//!             subplace,
//!         )
//!     };
//!
//!     (($place:place)) => { handle!($place) };
//!
//!     // value-to-place coercions are turned into temporaries:
//!     ($value:expr) => {{
//!         super let value = $value;
//!         handle!(value)
//!     }};
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Links to the types and traits used: [`LocalHandle`], [`IndexPlace`],
//! [`DerefPlace`], and [`ProjectPlace`].
//!
//! [`LocalHandle`]: crate::place::LocalHandle
//!
//! The need for a `subplace!` pseudo-macro might seem surprising, but it's
//! required to support *place wrappers*, which we will cover in the next
//! section. Without place wrappers, we could simply replace the `subplace!`
//! invocation with
//! <code><[field_of!](std::field::field_of)(typeof($place), $field)>::[default](Default::default)()</code>.
//!
//! ### Place Wrappers
//!
//! Place wrappers are a special kind of place proxy. They "physically contain"
//! the place they are proxying for. A good example is [`MaybeUninit<T>`]. To
//! support subplaces of these place wrappers, the [`WrapPlace`] trait exists.
//! It allows forwarding subplaces to the proxy and changing the subplace access
//! information. With [`MaybeUninit<T>`], this allows accessing any subplace
//! under the transformation that it's type is wrapped in `MaybeUninit`. So
//! Given `&MaybeUninit<Struct>`, the `field` subplace can be borrowed using `&`
//! and it has type `&MaybeUninit<Field>`.
//!
//! [`MaybeUninit<T>`]: std::mem::MaybeUninit
//!
//! ## Place Operation Traits
//!
//! Aside from the three basic place operations of [`ReadPlace`],
//! [`WritePlace`], and [`BorrowPlace`], there are also the following other
//! operations:
//!
//! - [`MovePlace`] -- moving out of a place (looks the same as a read
//!   operation).
//! - [`IndexPlace`] -- using the index operator on places (`place[idx]`).
//! - [`DerefPlace`] -- dereferencing a pointer that's in a place (`*place`).
//! - [`ProjectPlace`] -- accessing a subplace (`place.field`).
//! - [`DropPlace`] -- dropping the contents of a place (no surface syntax,
//!   emitted by the compiler).
//! - [`ReadMetadata`] -- TODO (no surface syntax, emitted by the compiler).
//! - [`ReadVariant`] -- TODO (no surface syntax, emitted by the compiler).
//! - [`VariantPlace`] -- TODO (no surface syntax, emitted by the compiler).
//!
//! The place operations are desugared in a similar manner to place expressions.
//! In particular, a place operation always operates upon a place expression,
//! which relies on the desugaring detailed in the previous section. Refer to
//! the operation traits for their desugaring.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! All operation functions are `unsafe`, since they have raw pointer arguments
//! that have safety preconditions. The arguments are raw pointers, because the
//! values they point to need not be in a valid state (they may be partially
//! moved out or borrowed).
//!
//! The safety requirements for the operation functions have not been figured
//! out at this point in time. Since we expect several changes to the design, we
//! do not want to commit to writing down good safety documentation before
//! having finished the design.
//!
//! What is clear at the moment is that the safety requirements will heavily
//! interact with the borrow checker. It will ensure that simultaneous place
//! operations on the same value are allowed, since they either affect disjoint
//! subplaces, or because they both only require shared access. For example:
//! - reading `ptr.field.subfield` and borrowing `ptr.field` with `&T` are
//!   allowed to happen at the same time,
//! - writing `ptr.field` and borrowing `ptr.field.subfield` at the same time is
//!   not allowed.
//!
//! The safety of using the place operations via the operators will depend on
//! the value of the `SAFE` constant in the operation traits. At the moment we
//! will only permit a literal value of `true` or `false` in implementations. It
//! will dictate if people have to write for example `unsafe { &*ptr }` or if
//! `*ptr` is allowed. It should be set to `true` when the borrow checker's
//! guarantees of either disjoint subplaces or "all concurrent operations are
//! shared" are enough to calling the operations' function correctly. If there
//! are additional requirements, such as "ptr is valid", then `SAFE` should be
//! set to `false`. For example, `&mut T` will have `SAFE = true` in
//! [`ReadPlace`], but `NonNull<T>` will set it to `false`.
//!
//! ### Handle Validity
