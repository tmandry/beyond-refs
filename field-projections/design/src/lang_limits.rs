/// Generate reflection information for ADTs.
///
/// The input should be structs and enums, which will be emitted as-is and in
/// addition, reflection information will be generated. This information is
/// exposed by generating two macros: - `field_of!($ty:ty, $field:ident)`
///
///   this macro returns the field representing type of the given field. It
///   implements the [`Subplace`] trait.
///
///   Note that this macro also supports fields of enum variants via the syntax
///   `field_of!(MyEnum::Variant, field)`. - `variant_of!($enum:ty,
///   $variant:ident)`
///
///   this macro returns the variant type of the given variant, which has the
///   same layout as the enum itself, but is statically guaranteed to be in the
///   given variant. In pattern type terms, this is just `pattern_type!($enum is
///   $variant { .. })` or `pattern_type!($enum is $variant(..))` depending on
///   the variant having named or unnamed fields.
